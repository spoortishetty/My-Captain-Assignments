Float datatype is derived from floating point number which is a representation of a number that includes both an integer part and a fractional part. 
It is one of the possible representations of what is often called real numbers.

A floating point number is commonly stored in two parts. One part is the mantissa, which contains the digits of the value. 
The other part is called the exponent, which expresses the magnitude of the value.
